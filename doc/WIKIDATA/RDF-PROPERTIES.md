The Wikidata data model is at the simplest level well-matched to RDF, as most data is encoded via an item (`rdf:subject`), a property (`rdf:predicate`) and a value for that property (`rdf:object`). The following table notes some of the standard properties in Wikidata that match standard RDF and RDFS predicates.

Wikidata labels and descriptions are however handled separately from properties; in the RDF dump they are translated into `rdfs`, `skos`, and `schema` predicates directly. In particular, a Wikidata label in a given language becomes an `rdfs:label`, `skos:prefLabel`, and `schema:name` in the dump. An alias (alternate label) becomes a `skos:altLabel`. The description strings become `schema:description` triples.
